# Cinaries (Container Image Binaries)

Cinaries (pronounced /saɪnɑːrɪz/) is an open-source project focused on reducing download times and the carbon footprint when using binaries from popular container images.

## Project Goals

- **Minimize Image Size**: Provide SCRATCH-based images that include only specific binaries from upstream container images, without unnecessary layers.
- **Improve Efficiency**: Cut down on download times by creating lightweight, versioned images containing just the binaries you need.
- **Sustainability**: Lower the overall carbon footprint of container-based deployments by reducing excess data transfer.
